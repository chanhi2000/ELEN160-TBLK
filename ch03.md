# Chapter 3. Metamathematics

> “Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, Church's Undecidability Theorem, Turing's Halting Problem — all have the flavor of some ancient tale which warns you that ‘To seek self-knowledge is to embark on a journey which ... will always be incomplete, cannot be charted on a map, will never halt, cannot be described’” 	*Douglas Hofstadter*[^1]

In conventional mathematics we generally start out with established axioms and theorems, and utilize precisely defined rules and procedures to prove new results. The proofs themselves are usually combinations of symbols and words that explain the logic behind this process. As the prefix ‘meta’ suggests, metamathematics goes beyond this traditional approach, and is interested in the *structure* of proofs.

In analyzing the way in which theorems are derived from axioms, it is often useful to represent all statements and arguments that constitute a proof in terms of numbers. Such a “translation" is sometimes referred to as the *arithmetization* of metamathematics, which can assume a variety of different forms. To get a sense for what this entails, consider the fact that the word “proof" can be encoded as $$\{16,\:18,\:15,\:15,\:6\}$$ by simply replacing each letter with the number that corresponds to its position in the alphabet. A more sophisticated approach would be to systematically assign a *single* number to each finite string of symbols. Given such a mapping, one could potentially translate all statements of a logical system into statements about integers. This kind of abstract representation lies at the heart of metamathematics, and is closely related to Gödel's famous Incompleteness Theorem.

The material presented in this chapter is designed to provide some insight into Gödel's fundamental result, whose implications for mathematics have been momentous. The concepts and ideas introduced in this chapter point to certain inherent limitations of human logic, which will subsequently be invoked in our discussion of the relationship between science and religion (see Chapters 9 and 10).
