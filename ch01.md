# Faith, Reason and Analogical Thinking
> “Life has taught me how to think, but thinking has not taught me how to live.“ Alexander Herzen[^1]

> “The value of speculative answers, however judicious, is limited. They clear the way for an apprehension of truth which speculation alone is powerless to reach. Peasants and housekeepers find what philosophers seek in vain; the substance of truth is grasped not by argument, but by faith.” Austin Farrer[^2]

At some point in life most of us begin to wonder about the purpose and meaning of our existence. More often than not, these questions arise when we face situations that force us to recognize the full extent of our limitations. Such encounters with reality can be overwhelming, and can lead to a reexamination of one's attitude toward religion. Scientists are certainly not exempt from such experiences, but what makes their response rather unique is an intense need for reconciling faith with reason. This need follows from the very nature of their profession, which allows little room for beliefs that have inadequate logical support. Such beliefs are usually rejected as irrational, or are (at best) accepted with a great deal of skepticism.

It is fair to say that the standards of rationality set by science have become prevalent in contemporary society. To a large extent, this trend reflects the gradual secularization of the Christian world which began with the emergence of modern science in the early 17th century. Over the past four hundred years, this process produced a deep chasm between science and religion, which has become increasingly difficult to bridge. The challenge is particularly daunting when it comes to the deep mysteries of faith, which often defy the basic concepts and categories of analytical thinking. When applied to such cases, conventional reasoning has little to contribute, and often leads to paradoxical conclusions. This apparent inconsistency has led to the rather widespread view that religious teachings lack coherency, and are therefore unacceptable to scientifically minded individuals

It would be wrong, of course, to assume that the position outlined above is universally accepted. Some prominent scientists (such as evolutionary biologist Steven Jay Gould, for example) have sought a more moderate stance, which see theology as a legitimate domain of human inquiry with its own method and logic. Thinkser of this persuasion emphasize, however, that such an approach to reality is completely unrelated to science, and that the two cannot be connected in any meaningful way. This outlook is usually supported by the observation that science deals with empirical facts and mathematical models, while religion addresses a very different set of questions, which primarily relate to meaning and value. Since the two filled appear to have little in common. It follows that a well informed and thoughtful person could conceivably engage in both without encountering serious logical difficulties.

> “I do not see how science and religion could be unified, or even synthesized, under any common scheme of explanation or analysis; but I also do not understand why toe enterprises should experience conflict.” Steven J. Gould[^3]

Gould's idea of “non-overlapping magisteria" strikes a rather conciliatory note, and seems to provide a sensible compromise in the debate between Science and religion. The question, however, is whether such a neutral Position is sustainable in practice. Several thinkers have been quick to point out that faith constitutes a global view of reality, and that its pronouncements must neCessarily apply to nature as well. They have also emphasized the fact that Science is inherently incomplete, since it is incapable of answering certain fundamental questions about the universe and the laws that govern it. Astrophysicist Robert Jastrow argues that such questions represent a natural point of contact between science and theology:

> “At this moment it seems as though science will never be able to raise the curtain on the mystery of creation. For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.” [^4]

While Jastrow makes a legitimate point regarding the limited scope of scientific inquiry, it is important to recognize that religious teachings have their own set of constraints. Theologians will readily concede, for example, that the language they use to describe God is hopelessly inadequate. Many of them will also agree that theological claims must meet certain standards of rationality in order to be intellectually acceptable to an educated population. These standards imply (among other things) that our beliefs about the nature of reality should not contradict established scientific knowledge.

> “Theological doctrines must be consistent with scientific evidence even if they are not directly implied by current scientific theories." Ian Barbour.[^5]

It would seem, then, that a certain amount of interaction between science and religion is unavoidable, and that the two disciplines cannot be completely separated. At the very least, they can scrutinize each other's claims, and servo to moderate extreme positions on both sides. In a more optimistic scenario, they might even act as an integrating factor for society. This is presumably what Pope John Paul II had in mind when he wrote that:

> “We must ask ourselves whether both science and religion will contribute to the integration of human culture or to its fragmentation. . A simple neutrality is no longer acceptable. We are asked to become one. We are not asked to become each other.” [^6]

The view expressed by John Paul II stresses the need to examine whether science and religion can coexist, and perhaps achieve some measure of cooperation. From a scientific standpoint, the answer to this question depends to a large extent on whether religious teachings can be perceived as rational. Given that this issue is a central theme in the chapters that follow, it seems appropriate to begin by examining what the attribute rational’ actually entails in this context. Does it mean that each theological statement must be accompanied by a rigorous logical proof before we can accept it? This would be an unreasonable requirement by any standard.

> “A proof, I suppose, is something that will convince anyone who is intelligent enough to understand it. If so, very little of interest regarding major philosophical issues can be proved ... So, if we demand proofs in philosophy, we will wind up as skeptics on all or nearly all of the important issues.” C. Stephen Layman[^7]

Layman's observation underscores the fact that beliefs are acquired in many different ways, and that pure logic and formal proofs are by no means the only acceptable techniques for resolving complex questions. It is interesting to note that this claim holds true in the domain of science as well. Indeed, it is well known that certain “informal” criteria such as simplicity and beauty have always played a key role in the process of scientific discovery, as have intuition and imagination.

> “No scientist thinks in formulae. ... The words of the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The physical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily reproduced and combined. ... Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a second stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will.” Albert Einstein[^8]

If we acknowledge (as Einstein did) that science is much more than a collection of impersonal and purely objective statements, it would make little sense to define rationality in strictly “formal” terms. What we need instead are criteria that are sufficiently flexible to capture the human experience in all its diversity.
