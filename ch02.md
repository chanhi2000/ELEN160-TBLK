# Chapter 2. Chaos, Complexity and Self-Organization

> “Chaos is anti-reductionist. This new science makes a strong claim about the world, namely, that when it comes to the most interesting questions, about order and disorder ... and life itself, the whole cannot be explained in terms of the parts. There are fundamental laws about complex systems, but they are new kinds of laws. They are laws of structure and organization and scale, and they simply vanish when you focus on the individual constituents of a complex system - just as the psychology of a lynch mob vanishes when you interview individual participants.” James Gleick'[^1]

The term “chaos theory” is a bit of a misnomer, since the phenomena that it deals with only appear to be random. In reality, these phenomena exhibit a subtle, high-level regularity that is not easily perceived, and can only be described in mathematical terms. Prior to the discovery of chaos in the early 1960s, physical processes were routinely classified as either deterministic or uncertain, but never both at once. The recognition that these two characteristics can coexist in a single system has been one of the great achievements of modern science. We now know that there are systems that inhabit the elusive “middle ground” between order and disorder, where genuine complexity and novelty can emerge.
