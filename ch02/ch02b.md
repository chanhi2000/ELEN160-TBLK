## 2.2 Strange Attractors and Fractals

Why do we use the attribute “strange” to describe chaotic attractors? The answer to this question appears to be obvious – one simply needs to contrast their highly unusual shapes with the shapes of more “conventional” attractors. There is, however, another reason for using this term, which has to do with the mathematical characterization of such objects. It turns out that chaotic attractors are *fractals*, which are considerably more complicated geometric forms than lines, surfaces or volumes. THis is yet another feature that distinguishes chaotic systems from their “well-behaved” counterparts.

Fractals have non-integer dimensions (such as $$0.6$$ or $$1.7$$, for example), which may sound completely counterintuitive to those who are used to classifying objects as one, two or three dimensional. ANd yet, such forms exist all around us. Modern Geometry allows us to assign dimensions to irregular shapes such as coastlines, clouds, forests., and *none* of these turn out to be integers.

Fractal structures can also be generated by computer programs, which typically amount to a set of simple recursive rules. THe patterns resulting from these computational procedures can be very intricate and aesthetically pleasing, as can be seen from __Fig. 2.10__. What is particularly striking about such objects is the fact that some form of order emerges on every level of magnification. Indeed, if we were to “zoom” into any of the spirals in __Fig. 2.10__, we should discover a set of new and equally fascinating geometric shapes.

#### Fig. 2.10 Example of a fractal

To better understand what fractal dimensions mean and how they can be calculated, we first need a definition of dimensionality which is broader than the traditional Euclidean one. While there are a number of such definitions, in the following we will focus on one which is known as *capacitive dimension*. In describing this notion, it is helpful to imagine a sheet of paper that has randomly distributed points and lines of it, as well as areas of empty space (a situation that is not altogether uncommon in modern abstract paint),. We will now divide the paper into “squares” with sides of length $$\epsilon$$, where $$\epsilon$$ is initially a number of our choices. If $$N(\epsilon)$$ denotes the number of squares that contain points and lines, we can introduce a quantity $$C(\epsilon)$$, which is defined as
$$
C(\epsilon)=\frac{\ln{(N(\epsilon))}}{\ln{\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)}}\tag{2.1}
$$

where the symbol Ln denotes the natural logarithm. By systematically decreasing the value of $$\epsilon$$ (while computing the corresponding $$C(\epsilon)$$ in each step), we will ultimately reach the limiting value
$$
d_C=\lim_{\epsilon\to0}{C(\epsilon)}\tag{2.2}
$$

which is known as the capacitive dimension of our set.

The above definition is remarkably general and can be applied to virtually any geometric object. When used to describe ordinary lines and surfaces, it produces values $$d_C=1$$ and $$d_C=2$$, respectively, which clearly conforms to our usual understanding of dimensionality. On the other hand, this techniques can also be applied to all kinds of irregular shapes, ranging from those found in nature to the abstract paintings of Jackson Pollock. What is particularly interesting about Pollock's work is his signature “drip and splash” technique, which involved an apparently random splattering of point onto a canvas that was placed on the floor of his studio. It turned out, however, that the results were not random at all. A careful analysis showed that his paintings had definite fractal dimension, which increased as he matured a s an artist.[^2]

The following simple example further illustrates how fractal differ from ordinary geometric objects, and how their dimension can be computed in a systematic manner.

### Example 2.1. 
Let us consider the procedure outlined in __Fig. 2.11__, which produces a rather unusual geometric object. In the first step of this algorithm, a line of unit length is partitioned into three equal segments. The middle segment is then replaced by an equilateral triangle, whose bottom side is removed.

#### Fig. 2.11 Construction of a Koch curve.

If this  simple operation is recursively repeated on each segment, after n steps we will obtain a rather “jagged” looking collection of $$N(\epsilon)=4^n$$ line segments, each of length $$\epsilon=\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n$$. When $$n\to\infty$$, this object turns into what is known as a *Koch curve*, whose capacitive dimension is
$$
\begin{align*}
d_C&=\lim_{\epsilon\to0}{\left[\frac{\ln{\left(N(\epsilon)\right)}}{\ln{\left(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}\right)}}\right]}\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}{\left[\frac{\ln{\left(4^n\right)}}{\ln{\left(3^n\right)}}\right]}\\
&=1.261
\end{align*}\tag{2.3}
$$

Since the value of $$d_C$$ lies between $$1$$ and $$2$$, it is fair to say that the Koch curve is in some sense more complex than a line, but less complex than a surface. THis is not something that we encounter in dealing with “ordinary” geometric forms, whose dimension always take on integer values.

It is interesting to note that the Koch curve actually has an “invisible” microscopic structure whose cumulative length is *infinite*. TO get a sense for how something like this is possible, imagine that we have  a measurement device with an exceptionally high resolution, which can distinguish segments that are as small as $$10^{-15}$$ meters (this is roughly the diameter of an atomic nucleus). If our initial line happens to be 1 meter long, such a device would presumably allow us to precisely record how the length of the object evolves during the first $$32$$ steps of the construction process (since $$\left(\tfrac{1}{3}\right)^{32}=0.54\times10^{-15}$$).

The maximal length that we would be able to measure in this way is
$$
L_\text{max}=\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{32}=9.95\times10^3\tag{2.4}
$$

which is slightly less than $$10$$ kilometers. Beyond that limit, changes in the segments simply become too small for detection. We do not, on the other hand, that the length of the Koch curve grows as.
$$
L(n)=\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^n\tag{2.5}
$$

and therefore tends to infinity as $$n$$ increases. This, however, is something that our measurement instruments *can not* detect. From our perspective, the curve freezes at a point that is defined by the resolution of the measurement apparatus, and appears to have a finite length. This explains how such an object can be “neatly packed” into a unit square, despite the fact that $$L\to\infty$$
