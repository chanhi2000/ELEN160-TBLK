# Faith, Reason and Analogical Thinking

## Reason and Faith
Although the probabilistic model outlined above provides a reasonably systematic framework for analyzing religious hypotheses, it would be entirely inappropriate to assume that theoretical conclusions of any kind (however logically sound they may be) can provide a proper foundation for religious belief.

> “Philosophical thinking can enable us to see through objections to Christian belief. ... but it rarely, if ever, propels one into a condition of faith.” William P. Alston[13]

> “You can find truth with logic only if you have already found truth without it.” G. K. Chesterton [14]

I am inclined to agree with Alston that religious belief is not something that can be based on formal proofs. Faith, like love, is first and foremost an experience, which is rarely (if ever) the result of careful analysis. I also consider it quite unlikely that skeptics and atheists can be swayed by argument demonstrating that religion is not inherently irrational. However, for those who believes completely separated. There are at least two reasons why this is so. To begin with, we should observe that much of what we do and desire is based on our core belief system (i.e., our *Weltbild*), which clearly includes our attitude, toward religion. In deciding between different courses of action we generally consult these beliefs, so their rationality is clearly relevant. It is difficult to envision how a distorted view of reality could be conductive to the fulfillment of our purpose, however noble these may be.
